# Local-Weather-App

## Description
This application was created to allow users to access data from a third- party API to display the weather outlook for different cities to better
prepare for the weather conditions of that city for purposes of travel. The application will utilize a search tool to input a specific city
and will display the current and future weather condition including a five-day forecast. The application will utilize local storage to store 
previous search queries for retrieval later. The user will be able to see the city name, the date, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. 
The five day weather forecast will also display the same information. In order to view the data of a previously searched city, the query will appear as 
a button on the left of the screen
